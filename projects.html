    <h3><img src="/img/localjs-icon.png"> <a href="http://httplocal.com" style="color: #4283CA;">Local.js</a></h3>
    <p>A research project to create a new Web plugins architecture which is managed in the application-layer. Designed to give users control over the behaviors of Web applications by splitting the app into processes. Web Workers safely contain untrusted code, while the Page acts as a trusted kernel for executing privileged requests. All processes behave as services and communicate using HTTP.<br><small><a href="http://httplocal.com">project site</a> <a href="https://github.com/pfraze/local">repo</a></small></p>
    <ul>
      <li><small><strong>Intended purpose</strong>: user-extensible Web applications, browser "operating systems."</small></li>
      <li><small><strong>Novel technologies</strong>: HTTP interface to local functions and threads; on-demand delivery of Worker services (initial request creates); typed-link-driven behaviors.</small></li>

    <h3><img src="/img/stdrel-icon.png"> <a href="http://stdrel.com" style="color: gray">STDRel.com</a></h3>
    <p>A library of link relation types (reltypes) which captures common Web API patterns. Part of a wider strategy to use browser-like techniques to drive host-independent Web applications. Made to support Local.js projects, but applies widely to the Web.<Br><small><a href="http://stdrel.com">project site</a> <a href="https://github.com/pfraze/stdrel.com">repo</a></small></p>
