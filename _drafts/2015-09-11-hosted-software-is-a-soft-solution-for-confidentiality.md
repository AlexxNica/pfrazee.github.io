Businesses sell user-data.
They sell it to do [targeted advertising.](http://idlewords.com/talks/internet_with_a_human_face.htm#ads)
They sell it to evaluate people's [credit-worthiness, insurance claims, health, and purchasing history](http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/money/consumer-protection/big-brother-is-watching/overview/index.htm).
Sometimes they just sell it in bulk, like when [MySpace needed to liquidate](http://readwrite.com/2010/03/12/myspace_bulk_data).

Programmers pride themselves on solving hard problems with hard solutions.
We prefer cryptography to regulations, because the crypto won't change.
Hard solutions are in our control.

But, hosted software has risks which engineers can't control.
You can harden the system, but you can't harden the org.
If a C-Level decides to sell the database, then they can.
