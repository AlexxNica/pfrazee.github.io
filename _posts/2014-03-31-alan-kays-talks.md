*human interaction design*

Kay starts with history-in-demos of GUIs, including videos of [Sutherland's Sketchpad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sketchpad), [Englebart's Mother of all Demos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mother_of_All_Demos), and PARC's research. He then shares some insights on human learning, including a "20-minute tennis lesson."

*OO, software-design*

A detailed criticism of the state-of-the-industry in 1997, and a walk-through of Kay's values for good software design. A great way to understand OO's basic intentions and find some context for the last 15 years of software.

A criticism of industry culture and modern architectural decisions.
