### [Can We Trust Trust?](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.24.5695&rep=rep1&type=pdf)

*philosophy*

> When we say we trust someone or that someone is
trustworthy, we implicitly mean that the probability that he will perform an action that is
beneficial or at least not detrimental to us is high enough for us to consider engaging in some
form of cooperation with him.

### [Temporal Factors to evaluate trustworthiness of virtual identities](http://www.tara.tcd.ie/bitstream/handle/2262/39200/Temporal%20Factors.pdf)

*analysis, model design*

> We hypothesise that temporal factors like
degree of activity, presence, regularity and frequency of
interactions can be meaningful used in a trust computation.
Since in these environments it is
easy to create, change and delete identities, the fact that
a virtual identity shows temporal stability and continuous
activity appears an interesting property.

### [B-trust: Bayesian Trust Framework for Pervasive Computing](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/d.quercia/publications/querciaB-trust06.pdf)

*analysis, model design*

> Significant commercial benefits are predicted from the deployment of new services that
pervasive computing will enable. These benefits are, however, theoretical in the absence
of appropriate security.


<br>
### [Ratings in Distributed Systems: A Bayesian Approach](http://publications.csail.mit.edu/lcs/pubs/pdf/MIT-LCS-TM-617.pdf)

*analysis, model design*

> Reputation is the perception that an agent creates through past actions about its intentions and norms. We argue that the failure of existing rating systems is partially due to the lack of personalization and
contextualization in these systems.


<br>
### [Trust-Based Security in Pervasive Computing Environments](http://ebiquity.umbc.edu/_file_directory_/papers/73.pdf)

*access control, system design*

> Centaurus uses a distributed model in
which hierarchically arranged security
agents manage security and trust. It views delegation as a right
itself. 



<br>
### [Distributed Trust](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~angelos/Papers/2004/tmreview.pdf)

*access controls, system design*

> There are a number of fundamental
reasons that ACLs are inadequate for distributed-system security.
Delegation is necessary for scalability of a distributed system. It enables decentralization of
administrative tasks.
