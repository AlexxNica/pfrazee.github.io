The news that Oculus VR has been bought by a major player would be upsetting no matter who it was &ndash; Microsoft, Google, Apple &ndash; but Facebook? Good God, why did it have to be Facebook?

The only nice reply to this acquisition is, "Hey, maybe Facebook **won't** touch it." I'm holding out hope, but not much. In the mean-time, I'd like to get out all my frustrations with this deal. I have a few.

### Closing doors

The Oculus Rift is an exciting piece of tech, not just as an device, but as an untied piece of hardware. It's not just about what it does: it's about what it offers the software world. VR&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;business&nbsp;opportunity &ndash; a big one.

VRUIs reset the interaction model. All the patterns which have standardized for the past thirty years get to be re-examined. For the hackers, it's really exciting: a tabula rasa.

So in the back of our heads, or in notebooks somewhere, you can bet a lot developer's project checklists lead to the same place. "Do this, do that, work on this &ndash; good you'll be ready for the Oculus release." VRUI is in a lot of people's career paths, and now Facebook has the first shot. That's really disappointing.

### Culture Clash

I don't want to have to work at a specific company to work on the underlying software. Computers don't require it, and it happens frequently now as a quirk of the Web's remote-service-bound architecture. Closed architectures are anti-hacker.

As IT works into our social lives, and as the economics flow toward platform-owners, you have to ask what effect there is on society when the reigns get to be held&ndash; by anyone. Will FacebookVR win by merit, or by sheer position?

It's not like everything is closed forever, but this deal smacks of IBM's pairing with Microsoft (the guys who ripped off Apple (the guys who ripped off Xerox PARC, and who, for that matter, [ripped off the intentially-limited designs](http://worrydream.com/refs/Vannevar%20Bush%20Symposium%20-%20Closing%20Panel.html))). OSX and Windows are third-hand knockoffs of that research team's admittedly bad ideas, and now those designs are the standard. Traction matters.

Let's talk about that other thing.

### IT Ethics

Hosting people's personal data in a corporate database is wrong, flatly wrong. It's wrong for anybody, but Facebook's the most active offenders. Friend lists, personal photos, relationships, messages &ndash; even though users give them up freely, it's wrong to take them. Consider how damaging that dataset can be under security breaches, or government overreach, or the desperate need to monetize Facebook Inc. as it reaches its latter days.

IT ethics means that you use your expertise to actively protect sensitive information. They don't do that, and there can be &ndash; will be &ndash; consequences. If anybody could have pushed an effective self-hosting platform to segment the social dataset, it's them, but they haven't. You can list any number of frustrations, but that's where the buck stops: they had position, they could've done the ethical thing, and they didn't.

### And after all that support

To quote my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/justin_winslow">Justin Winslow</a>: "Oculus was a Kickstarter project? Do the contributors get cash monies in the buy out? That seems pretty fucked."

I can't begin to imagine what the *need* for this buyout was. Oculus VR had just raised a $75MM Series B and was effortlessly selling pre-orders to their second iteration of the developer's kit. If Facebook brings Oculus anything other than a software team to work on The Ordained VRUI Platform, I'll eat my hat &ndash; but of course, that's exactly what this is for.

VRUIs are going to decide the next generations of computing. I can't think of anything worse than Facebook being on the forefront of that, and that's what this deal buys them. Meanwhile, it buys Oculus VR what they (excitingly) didn't originally take: pole position in the software front.
