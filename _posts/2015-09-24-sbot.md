**Good news! Secure Scuttlebutt's server, [Scuttlebot](https://github.com/ssbc/scuttlebot), is now available.**

[Secure Scuttlebutt](https://github.com/ssbc/secure-scuttlebutt) is a project started by [Dominic Tarr](https://twitter.com/dominictarr).
It started as a small spec and a library which wrapped LevelDB.
A year  ago I joined Dominic, and today we're finally ready to release Scuttlebot, a complete SSB server.

## Project Mission

**Our mission is to create desktop applications that out-compete Web applications.**

We think desktop applications have two qualities that the Web can't match:

 1. **Confidentiality.** Desktop applications don't emit user behavior to hosts, or depend on hosts to provide security.
 2. **Autonomy.** Desktop applications put business logic in the client, which allows users to control the most important behaviors of their software.

Not only are these qualities important for FOSS, they're important for expanding choice and protecting user's rights.
But, for desktop applications to really be *better* than Web apps, they have to solve a lot of shortcomings:

 - **Connectivity**, so they can network as effectively as Web applications do.
 - **Sandboxing**, so installing apps isn't a risk.
 - **Code-signing** and **Auditing**, so giving apps permissions isn't a risk.
 - **Cross-app-RPC**, so you can write apps that depend on each other.
 - **Orchestration**, so you don't task the user with configuration.
 - **Auto-updating**, so apps don't have to bother users with manual patching.

We plan to create a set of tools which solve each of these problems.
We want a cross-platform desktop environment that's convenient, connective, extensible, and secure.

Scuttlebot is our first package release.
It's primarily a solution to connectivity, but it's also going to be useful for code-signing, auditing, and auto-updating.
Let's look at the details.

## Secure Scuttlebutt

**Secure Scuttlebutt (SSB)** is a P2P database of message-feeds.
It consists of

- Per-user append-only logs of messages (i.e. [kappa architecture](http://www.kappa-architecture.com/))
- Content-addressable storage (i.e. `obj.id == hash(obj)`)
- Message distribution over a [gossip network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gossip_protocol)

[Scuttlebot](https://github.com/ssbc/scuttlebot) is an SSB server.
It provides the SSB database, a networked blob-store, the gossip protocol, [secure channels](https://github.com/dominictarr/secret-handshake), and a CLI and RPC interface.

Intuitively, you can think of SSB as behaving like Twitter.
Each user has their own feed for publishing typed messages.
By following feeds, users can sync and share data between devices.

### Secure Gossip Networking

SSB is a [P2P gossip network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gossip_protocol).
This means that information is able to distribute across multiple machines, without requiring direct connections between them.

![Gossip graph](/img/gossip-graph1.png)

Even though Alice and Dan lack a direct connection, they can still exchange feeds:

![Gossip graph 2](/img/gossip-graph2.png)

This is because gossip creates "transitive" connections between computers.
Dan's messages travel through Carla and the Pub to reach Alice, and visa-versa.
Because all feeds are signed, if Dan has confirmed Alice's pubkey, then Dan doesn't have to trust Carla *or* the Pub to receive Alice's messages from them.

---

### Network Integrity

To make sure the network converges to the correct state, Scuttlebot uses the append-only log [CRDT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type).
The append-only constraint is enforced with a blockchain structure: each entry includes the hash of the previous message.
If a peer receives a message with a `previous` hash that doesn't match its local cache, it'll reject the offending message.
(There is no Proof-of-Work; each log maintains an independent order.)

---

### Message Semantics

Messages and links in SSB are typed, but SSB doesn't try to impose any validation or schemas.
Each message is a simple JSON object:

```js
{
   type: 'post', // the only required field
   text: 'Hello, @alice!',
   mentions: [{
      link: '@hxGxqPrplLjRG2vtjQL87abX4QKqeLgCwQpS730nNwE=.ed25519',
      name: 'alice'
   }]
}
```

This is a `post`-type message with a `mentions`-type link.
Scuttlebot creates indexes on these types.
Interpretation and validation is left to the applications, per the [Kappa Architecture](http://www.kappa-architecture.com/).

Each user maintains a separate log, and each log is an ordered list of these messages.
Scuttlebot [provides an API](https://github.com/ssbc/docs/blob/master/intro-to-using-sbot.md) for querying and streaming these logs.

---

### Confidentiality and Spam-prevention


For private sharing, Scuttlebot uses [libsodium](http://doc.libsodium.org/) to encrypt confidential log-entries.
Log IDs are public keys, and so once two logs are mutually following each other, they can exchange confidential data freely.

Spam is a fundamental problem any network design.
Email is famously vulnerable to spam.
To send someone an email, all that is required is to have their address.
This allows unsolicited messaging.

Scuttlebot uses an explicit "follow" mechanism, to opt into logs to receive.
We call this "Solicited Spam."
Follows are published, and then graph analysis can be applied to the friend network - spammers may be isolated, or clustered together and filtered out.

## Project Links

Scuttlebot includes a lot of novel software by Dominic, including [pull-streams](https://github.com/dominictarr/pull-streams), [a lightweight RPC library](https://github.com/ssbc/muxrpc), and [a capabilities-based secure channel protocol](https://github.com/dominictarr/secret-handshake).

We'll follow this soon with a Twitter-clone application called Patchwork, and an Electron apps platform that's now in development, called Brickhouse.
