> **Good news! The [Scuttlebot P2P database beta 1](https://github.com/ssbc/scuttlebot) is now available.**

> [Secure Scuttlebutt](https://github.com/ssbc/secure-scuttlebutt) is a P2P database protocol created by [Dominic Tarr](https://twitter.com/dominictarr).
It started as a small spec and a library which wrapped LevelDB.
A year ago I joined Dominic on the project, and today we're ready to release beta 1 of the [Scuttlebot P2P database](https://github.com/ssbc/scuttlebot).

*It's decentralized!*

## The Challenge with P2P

Peer-to-peer, decentralized applications are hard to write.
Why?

 - **Availability.** Users' devices turn on and off all the time. Managing connection life-cycles while providing a good user-experience takes a lot of work. NAT and firewalls make this even harder.
 - **Data Consistency.** Without a single authority, it's easy for state to go out-of-sync between computers. If that happens, fixing the network without data-loss is extremely difficult.
 - **Data Integrity.** The problem of data-consistency is even worse in an attacker scenario. Ensuring peers don't lie to each other is key. (That includes dropping and re-ordering messages.)
 - **Confidentiality.** Encryption depends on certificate distribution, which is not an adequately-solved problem in global p2p networks.

Wouldn't it be great if your database handled all that for you?
That's the idea here.

**Scuttlebot is a general-purpose EC database for P2P, decentralized applications.**
It's designed for desktops and servers, and supports a wide variety of apps: photo- and file-sharing, encrypted messaging, office productivity, knowledge bases, etc.

Scuttlebot solves the hard problems underlying P2P so developers can focus on data and applications.
It gives desktop software the same kind of connectivity you'd expect from the Web, but with end-to-end confidentiality and no host dependency.

Let's dive into the details of the protocol and architecture.

## Secure Scuttlebutt

**Secure Scuttlebutt (SSB)** is a P2P database protocol of message-feeds.
It consists of

- Per-user append-only logs of messages (i.e. [kappa architecture](http://www.kappa-architecture.com/))
- Content-addressable storage (i.e. `obj.id == hash(obj)`)
- Message distribution over a [gossip network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gossip_protocol)

[Scuttlebot](https://github.com/ssbc/scuttlebot) is an SSB server.
It provides the SSB database, a networked blob-store, the gossip protocol, and a CLI and RPC interface.


### Data Structures

Intuitively, you can think of SSB as structured like Twitter.
All data is structured into _Feeds_, _Messages_, and _Blobs_.
A Message is a single post, and a Feed is an ordered log of messages.
A Blob is textual or binary data referenced in a message (similar to an email attachment).

Messages contain the ID of the feed they are in, the hash of the previous message, some arbitary JSON content (or an encrypted base64 string), and a signature.
Because each message is signed, anyone can verify that a given message belongs to a particular Feed.

### Links

Messages, feeds, and blobs are addressable by specially-formatted identifiers.
Message and blob IDs are content-hashes, while feed IDs are public keys.

To indicate the type of ID, a "sigil" is prepended to the string. They are:

 - `@` for feeds
 - `%` for messages
 - `&` for blobs

Additionally, each ID has a "tag" appended to indicate the hash or key algorithm.
Some example IDs:

 - A feed: `@LA9HYf5rnUJFHHTklKXLLRyrEytayjbFZRo76Aj/qKs=.ed25519`
 - A message: `%MPB9vxHO0pvi2ve2wh6Do05ZrV7P6ZjUQ+IEYnzLfTs=.sha256`
 - A blob: `&Pe5kTo/V/w4MToasp1IuyMrMcCkQwDOdyzbyD5fy4ac=.sha256`

When IDs are found in the messages, they are treated as links, with the keyname acting as a "relation" type.
SSB automatically builds an index based on these links, to allow queries such as "all messages with a `mentions` link to this user."


### Message Content

Messages and links in SSB are typed, but SSB doesn't try to impose any validation or schemas.
Each message is a simple JSON object:

```js
{
   type: 'post', // the only required field
   text: 'Hello, @alice!',
   mentions: [{
      link: '@hxGxqPrplLjRG2vtjQL87abX4QKqeLgCwQpS730nNwE=.ed25519',
      name: 'alice'
   }]
}
```

This is a `post`-type message with a `mentions`-type link.
Scuttlebot creates indexes on these types.
Interpretation and validation is left to the applications, per the [Kappa Architecture](http://www.kappa-architecture.com/).

Each user maintains a separate log, and each log is an ordered list of these messages.
Scuttlebot [provides an API](https://github.com/ssbc/docs/blob/master/intro-to-using-sbot.md) for querying and streaming these logs.

### Secure Gossip Networking

SSB is a [gossip network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gossip_protocol).
This means that information is able to distribute across multiple machines, without requiring direct connections between them.

![Gossip graph](/img/gossip-graph1.png)

Even though Alice and Dan lack a direct connection, they can still exchange feeds:

![Gossip graph 2](/img/gossip-graph2.png)

This is because gossip creates "transitive" connections between computers.
Dan's messages travel through Carla and the Pub to reach Alice, and visa-versa.
Because all feeds are signed, if Dan has confirmed Alice's pubkey, then Dan doesn't have to trust Carla *or* the Pub to receive Alice's messages from them.

"Pubs" are public nodes that help us get around [NAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation) and the lack of IP addresses.
They aren't hosts, and have no special privileges, but they are often required to get global connectivity.
In a LAN, they're not needed.

### Network Integrity

To make sure the network converges to the correct state, Scuttlebot uses the append-only log [CRDT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type).
The append-only constraint is enforced with a blockchain structure: each entry includes the hash of the previous message.
If a peer receives a message with a `previous` hash that doesn't match its local cache, it'll reject the offending message.
(There is no Proof-of-Work; each log maintains an independent order.)


### Confidentiality and Spam-prevention


For private sharing, Scuttlebot uses [libsodium](http://doc.libsodium.org/) to encrypt confidential log-entries.
Log IDs are public keys, and so once two logs are mutually following each other, they can exchange confidential data freely.

Spam is a fundamental problem any network design.
Email is famously vulnerable to spam.
To send someone an email, all that is required is to have their address.
This allows unsolicited messaging.

Scuttlebot uses an explicit "follow" mechanism, to opt into logs to receive.
We call this "Solicited Spam."
Follows are published, and then graph analysis can be applied to the friend network - spammers may be isolated, or clustered together and filtered out.


### SSB Compared to Other Protocols

SSB shares some features with Bitcoin, including the use of a Blockchain, but it does not use Proof-of-Work.
This is because Bitcoin shares one blockchain with many users, while SSB gives one blockchain to each user.
(SSB's feeds are blockchains.)

Unlike BitTorrent or [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/), SSB does not maintain a distributed hash-table.
Instead, it uses a gossip protocol which syncs regularly with all known peers.
SSB is also more focused on syncing application data, while BitTorrent and IPFS focus on file-exchange.
